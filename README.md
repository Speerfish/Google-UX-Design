>2.3 Creating a Morgue

>An invaluable tool to start building right now is a morgue; a collection of images, photographs, samples and examples of colors and materials, and the like (see Figure 2.1). Your morgue >should contain anything that visually inspires or affects you both in positive and in negative ways. It is a visual diary of sorts made from various sources, even your own work. It can >contain real materials such as clothes, paper, rusty nails, washers—whatever you want to keep on record. For instance, I keep graphic design images to use for reference of type styles or >current color usage.

>They all inspire me to create. Use your morgue not only as reference for reproducing textures for a project, but also to define your likes and dislikes—to see how they change over time. >Morgues can be loose pages and items categorized into folders or pasted into sketchbooks or scrapbooks. This library-like collection is for you. Make it your own!
